<h1>IControlU</h1>

IControlU operates as a remote access trojan, employing SSH, Batch, and PowerShell scripts to execute its exploit, effectively evading detection by Windows' Microsoft Defender Antivirus. This project serves as a Proof-of-Concept (POC), illustrating that Windows may not consistently detect such malicious actions. Notably, IControlU incorporates various exploit modules, including a keylogger, webcam access, and more.
